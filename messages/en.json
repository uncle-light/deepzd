    "title": "FAQ",
    "q1": {
      "question": "What is GEO?",
      "answer": "GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) is a content optimization strategy for AI search engines, proposed by top institutions like Princeton University, helping your content get cited and recommended by ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity and other AI."
    },
    "q2": {
      "question": "How is GEO different from SEO?",
      "answer": "Traditional SEO targets search engine rankings on Google, while GEO focuses on getting AI to understand and cite your content. SEO pursues clicks, GEO pursues citations; SEO values keywords and backlinks, GEO values structure, authority, and information density."
    },
    "q3": {
      "question": "Which industries need GEO most?",
      "answer": "All content-driven industries need GEO, especially B2B services, SaaS products, professional consulting, education, healthcare, and finance. Users in these fields increasingly rely on AI for professional advice."
    },
    "q4": {
      "question": "How long does GEO take to show results?",
      "answer": "Like SEO, GEO is a continuous optimization process. Optimized content typically takes 1-3 months to be re-indexed and learned by AI. However, structural improvements immediately enhance content quality, with more significant long-term effects."
    },
    "q5": {
      "question": "How do I measure GEO effectiveness?",
      "answer": "You can measure through: 1) Asking AI relevant questions and observing if your content is cited; 2) Monitoring brand mentions in AI responses; 3) Tracking referral traffic from AI platforms; 4) Using professional AI visibility monitoring tools."
    },
    "q6": {
      "question": "What content does AI crawl?",
      "answer": "AI primarily sources from public webpages, academic papers, news media, Wikipedia, official documentation, etc. Ensuring your content is indexable, well-structured, and from credible sources is essential for AI citation."
    },
    "q7": {
      "question": "Can small websites benefit from GEO?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. AI doesn't rely on domain authority as heavily as traditional search engines. As long as content is professional, well-structured, and accurate, small websites have equal opportunities to be cited. Deep content in niche areas often has an advantage."
    },
    "q8": {
      "question": "Do I still need GEO if I do SEO?",
      "answer": "Yes. SEO and GEO are complementary, not substitutes. Good SEO foundations help GEO, but GEO has unique strategies like adding citations, using statistics, and directly answering questions—areas traditional SEO rarely focuses on."
